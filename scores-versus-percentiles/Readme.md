# Raw Scores versus Population-based Percentiles: Implications for Linear Regression

Can linear regression analysis (specifically, Pearson's *r* correlation) of raw scores versus population percentiles underestimate the underlying relationship between two noisy measurement methods?

Start by reading `simulated-correlation-analysis.ipynb`. Then download the Excel spreadsheet `hidden-rank-correlation-example-static.xlsx`. It presents a hand-crafted pathological dataset of Big Five personality traits as measured using two methods, "Watson" and "questionnaire". There are no significant Pearson correlations for any of the five traits, but the two methods agree *perfectly* on each subject's most prominent trait. It's left as an exercise to the reader to decide how realistic this pathological scenario really is.
